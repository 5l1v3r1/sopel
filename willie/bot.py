        `=`, it will be ensured that the capability is enabled. Requiring and
        disabling is "first come, first served"; if one module requires a
        capability, and another prohibits it, this function will raise an
        exception in whichever module loads second. An exception will also be
        raised if the module is being loaded after the bot has already started,
        and the request would change the set of enabled capabilities.

        If the capability is not prefixed, and no other module prohibits it, it
        will be requested.  Otherwise, it will not be requested. Since
        capability requests that are not mandatory may be rejected by the
        server, as well as by other modules, a module which makes such a
        request should account for that possibility.

        The actual capability request to the server is handled after the
        completion of this function. In the event that the server denies a
        request, the `failure_callback` function will be called, if provided.
        The arguments will be a `Willie` object, and the capability which was
